                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Numpy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and a large number of mathematical functions to operate on these data structures. Numpy is the core library for performing numerical operations and is often used as the foundation for other data analysis and machine learning libraries.</p>
                <p>Developed in the early 2000s by Travis Olliphant, Numpy has grown to become an integral part of the scientific Python ecosystem. Its efficient handling of large datasets and its ability to perform complex mathematical computations have made it a go-to library for data scientists and engineers worldwide.</p>
                <p>The Numpy library is built on top of the C programming language, which provides its core functionality. This allows Numpy to perform computations with high performance and efficiency, even with large-scale data. The library also provides interoperability with other libraries and tools, making it a versatile choice for various computational tasks.</p>
                <p>In addition to its core array capabilities, Numpy includes modules for linear algebra, random number generation, Fourier transforms, and more. This extensive functionality makes it a valuable tool for a wide range of applications, from basic numerical computations to advanced scientific research.</p>

                <h2>Basic Usage</h2>
                <p>Hereâ€™s a simple example of creating an array with Numpy:</p>
                <pre><code>
import numpy as np

# Create a 1D array
array = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

# Print the array
print(array)

# Create a 2D array (matrix)
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

# Print the matrix
print(matrix)

# Perform element-wise operations
result = array * 2
print(result)

# Compute the mean of the array
mean_value = np.mean(array)
print(f"Mean value: {mean_value}")

# Perform matrix multiplication
product = np.dot(matrix, matrix.T)
print(product)
                </code></pre>
